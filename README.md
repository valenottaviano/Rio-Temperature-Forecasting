# Rio Temperature Forecasting

### Context
This datasets are collected in order to provide some answers for the above question through Data Analysis. Maybe you want to try some Machine Learning model in order to practice and predict the evolution of temperature in some Brazilian cities.

### Content
The content is provided by NOAA GHCN v4 and post-processed by NASA's GISTEMP v4.
In summary, each data file contains a temperature time series for a station named according to the city. The time series provides temperature records by month for each year. Some mean measurement is calculated, like metANN and D-J-F. I can't give details about these quantities, nor how they are calculated. Please refer for NASA GISTEMP website in this regard. The most important seems to be metANN, which is an annual temperature mean.
